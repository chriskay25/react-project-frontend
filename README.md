# React Project Frontend

This is the frontend of my final project for Flatiron School, though I've changed a lot since its first iteration. It's a simple game - control the player using arrow keys and try not to get hit by the incoming enemies.

The backend is available at https://github.com/chriskay25/react-project-backend.git.

### Installation
Clone or fork the repository from https://github.com/chriskay25/react-project-frontend.

Change directory in your terminal:

    $ cd react-project-frontend

Then run:

    $ npm install

In the project directory, you can run:

    $ npm start

Please note that you should already have the rails server running for the backend of this app. <br />

### Usage

When the app starts running, users can sign up for an account or log in so that their scores will be saved. Instructions for the game itself are displayed in the app.

### Contributing

2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature')
